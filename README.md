# PHPsec: A simple PHP-security-class to handle SuperGlobals

According to Google and W3techs 79.2% of website rely on PHP.

In my thirty year career I've encourtered security risks in all aspects of IT (companies).

tldr: Answer the following question: Safe or unsafe?
```
include $_GET['filename'];
```
Unsafe? You have come to the right place.

## Prerequisites

Can I speek freely? You need a brain to use this class. IT-Security is a big and complex issue. Using this class has no value if your server allows 1000 GET-params or standard queries (URLs) of 8K like this:

```
your-domain.net/index.php?param=php://filter/convert.iconv.UTF8.CSISO2022KR|convert.base64-encode|convert.iconv.UTF8.UTF7|convert.iconv.SE2.UTF-16
```

Your Apache (webserver) and PHP.INI should limit such requests depending on your project. A brain is needed.
